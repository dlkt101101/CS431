Write a program that every second reports what movements were performed by the robot in the last 3 seconds. You should also report the ratio of each movement. For example, if 10 movements are \"Slight-Right-Turn\" out of 50 movements in the last 3 seconds, your program should print: Slight-Right-Turn 0.2. Finally, the movements should be reported in the descending order of the radios. Make sure you print \"----------\" to indicate the end of each window.\n",
